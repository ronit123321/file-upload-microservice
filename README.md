# File Uploads Microservice

A small API server that lets you uploads and delete file directly from the front end.

Made as study prject starting from freecodecamp's [file metadata microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/file-metadata-microservice) challenge and improved with extra functionality :sparkles:

A demo for this project lives on glitch.

### How it works

Simply uploads a file via the upload button into the `uploads/` folder.

The programs return the size of that file.

You can also see the list of files stored into the `uploads/` folder and delete them.

### Features

**Express** to handle the server functionality

**Vue** to handle the front-end interactions

**stylus** for quick styling


*note:* vue and axios has been integrated via cdn since the app is small. For bigger usage definitely use a modular system like webpack.
